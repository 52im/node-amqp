Node AMQP

IMPORTANT: You need to use the net2 branch of node to use this!

This is totally not complete at all - you can subscribe to a queue,
but you can't publish or interact with exchanges yet.


See test.js for an example.



Major TODOs:
- Helper interfaces for receiving messages
- Publish to an exchange
- Test suite
